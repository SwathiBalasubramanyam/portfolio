							<header>
								<p>I'm an experienced Software quality assurance engineer turned Software Engineer. I possess a natural aptitude for problem-solving and I'm recognized for my inquisitive nature. As a team player, I approach my work with enthusiasm and am known for my patient and effective communication. 
									While working at Uncommon/Recruiter.ai, I discovered my passion for coding and its potential to create exceptional products. After a career break, I enrolled myself into App Academy's intensive, immersive program. This comprehensive training encompassed full-stack web development, including proficiency in JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, SQL, and MongoDB. I am currently seeking a new position where I can make a significant impact and collaborate with a highly motivated and dedicated team. If you're looking for someone, let's connect.

								<p>Outside of work, I am a mom, a dancer, a throwball player, a gardener. You'll probably find me performing at dance events, teaching kids to dance, tending to my garden, playing throwball in the park or simply spending time with my children. Here are some of my most treasured moments.</p>

									<p><strong> Erez Arnon</strong> (Co-Founder & Head of Engineering at Office Hours)</p>
									<p>"Swathi was an incredible hire and employee. She joined us as a QA Engineer, but due to her ability to learn quickly and willingness to take on challenges outside her comfort zone, I quickly promoted her to a Software Engineer. About a year later she was owning significant parts of our system with little guidance. Swathi was a pleasure to work with and mentor!"</p>
